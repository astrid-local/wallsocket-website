        <p>I've been working as a bank teller</p>
        <p>For like eleven years</p>
        <p>It all started when I didn't have</p>
        <p>Enough to pay for the crystal</p>
        <p>And ain't it funny how</p>
        <p>Outta nowhere, all this money appears?</p>
        <p>I've got a cash drawer and a keyboard</p>
        <p>And I've got all of your info</p>
        <br>
        <p>When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun</p>
        <p>Get on the inside?</p>
        <p>You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me</p>
        <p>When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun</p>
        <p>Get on the inside?</p>
        <p>You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I write false checks, I plant the counterfeits</p>
        <p>I trim the fat from the vault</p>
        <p>I need a John Smith or a Jane Doe</p>
        <p>The more common the better!</p>
        <p>I resurrect the dead, I hit the ATM, and I've never been caught</p>
        <p>I'm not the bad guy, like, it's just sitting there</p>
        <p>And the dead ain't getting any deader</p>
        <br>
        <p>When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun</p>
        <p>Get on the inside?</p>
        <p>You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me</p>
        <p>When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun</p>
        <p>Get on the inside?</p>
        <p>You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like</p>
        <p>Mm, you gotta do it like me</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's  a long con</p>
        <p>When you catch me I'll be long gone</p>
        <p>It's a long road, and I'll be on it 'til the case goes cold</p>
        <p>S-s-so long</p>
        <p>When you catch me I'll be long gone</p>
        <p>It's a long road, and I'll be on it 'til the case goes cold</p>
        <p><i>(Good luck)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm in the Super 8 and I've been MIA for like the past three days</p>
        <p>My family hates me, 'cause I heard the APB, and I made a run for the country</p>
        <p>I've found a small town, somewhere to hide out, until I'm sure that it's safe</p>
        <p>'Cause I had a suitcase in the crawlspace, and it's full of all of your money, ow!</p>
